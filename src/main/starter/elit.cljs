The game screams and thrashes through truly absurd comedy and intrigue and in those moments of exhaustion that result, when the caps lock vanishes, you peek into a much more painful, emotional wraught world beyond the heightened fantasy. Beautiful, painful, and healing in the way of something that reflects difficult emotions back at you."]

This is a good example of the interests of a lot of early combinatory poetry, a very simple algorithm creating permutations on an input, resulting in a strange effect as the lines vary over and over again but never very much. Here one of the permutations of this poem is read on a BBC program."]])
